# SQL Expression

This project is to abstract SQL queries into an easy-to-use (or at least easier-to-use) syntax.

### Done

- Insert SQL Expression

### How to begin

#### Using derby

Create a test database named "sample" on port 1527 for use with this project.
Usually, the default settings for creating a Netbeans database named "sample" should suffice.

When done creating the database, run the tests to see if they pass.
